# Changelog

All notable changes to `front` will be recorded here. Dates are ISO-8601.

The project follows a loose [SemVer](https://semver.org/) — major version
bumps mean the on-disk skill layout changes (users have to re-copy folders
into `~/.claude/skills/`).

## Releases

Each tagged release publishes five tarballs on GitHub Releases (one per
skill plus a bundle of all four) and a single `SHA256SUMS` covering
every artifact. Users download the bundle (or a per-skill tarball),
run `shasum -a 256 -c SHA256SUMS` to verify it, extract, and copy the
folders they need into `~/.claude/skills/`. The README's *Install*
section walks the full flow. To upgrade, repeat the steps with a newer
`VERSION` — the on-disk folder name is stable so the copy overwrites in
place. If the checksum check fails, do not install the artifact.
Release tarballs are produced by `scripts/release.sh <version>`.

## [0.3.2] — 2026-06-21

Cosmetic / hygiene patch release. Closes three of the five roadmap
items from 0.3.1: LISEZMOI parity, `references/` reshape
re-assessment, and `front-cli-gui` production-hardening notes. No
behaviour change for any script.

### Added — `front-cli-gui/references/hardening.md`

- New reference, ~250 lines, eight sections: loopback binding,
  bearer-token auth on `/run`, command + flag allow-list with
  path-traversal guard, subprocess sandbox (`shell=False`, `cwd`,
  scrubbed `env`, `start_new_session=True`, wall-clock timeout via
  `os.killpg`), per-token rate limit (in-memory sliding window), CORS
  posture (single pinned origin, no `*` with credentials), logging
  hygiene (cmd / exit / duration only — no argv, no token, no body),
  TLS terminated at a reverse proxy. Ends with a 10-line
  "before-promotion" checklist and a "when to outgrow the stdlib host"
  trigger list (multi-worker, schema validation, SSE reconnects,
  Tauri sidecar).
- Snippets follow the project's Python style — module imports,
  numpy-style docstrings on the non-trivial helpers (`validate`,
  `run_sandboxed`, `rate_limited`), full typing, dict over class.
- Wired into `front-cli-gui/SKILL.md` § References (the stale link to
  the never-shipped `cli-gui-workflow.md` was removed in the same
  pass).

### Changed — `LISEZMOI.md` brought back to parity

- New section "**État d'avancement**" mirrors the EN README "Status"
  table (eight rows, audio flagged WiP, version reference at 0.3.2).
- Audio row of "Entrées → sorties" flagged **WiP** with a back-link to
  the new section, matching the EN row.
- Install snippet bumped from `VERSION=0.3.0` to `VERSION=0.3.2`.

### Changed — `references/` reshape re-assessed

- The 0.3.1 roadmap item *"split teaching prose from rules
  (`<name>-rules.md` + `<name>-guide.md`)"* is **retired** rather than
  shipped. Audit showed the prose-trim pass on 2026-06-19 already
  addressed `o.md` § 7: `ux-psychology.md` (175 → 87 LOC),
  `material-design.md` (155 → 128 LOC), `color-psychology.md`
  (90 → 84 LOC). Remaining reference files are rule-shaped enough
  that a structural split would add friction without value.
  Documenting the decision here so the next reader doesn't re-litigate
  it.

### Changed — version bumps

- All four `SKILL.md` files bumped `0.3.1 → 0.3.2`. README + LISEZMOI
  install snippets bumped to `VERSION=0.3.2`. Status snapshot
  reference bumped to `v0.3.2`.

### Fixed

- **`front-cli-gui/SKILL.md` referenced a non-existent file**
  (`references/cli-gui-workflow.md`). Replaced with the real
  `references/hardening.md` link.

## Roadmap

Open threads carried into 0.4.0. Both remaining items are paused on
explicit user signal — do not restart without one.

1. **Captions WER baselines + `vocab-biasing-clip.wav`.** User has
   deferred audio fixture work pending dataset acquisition (Common
   Voice 26.0 tarballs are 25–88 GB per language). When they signal:
   run `tests/fixtures/audio/extract_cv_subset.py` per language,
   commit MANIFEST + STATS + transcripts, publish median WER in
   `front-a11y/references/captions-ai.md`.
2. **Real end-to-end application example.** User has deferred. Scope
   pre-decided: wrap `md2star` (user's own CLI) with a Tauri shell
   that invokes it as a sidecar — not another mock SSE proxy. The
   `cli-gui-demo` stays as the scaffold reference; the Tauri example
   becomes the production reference.

Adoption-side milestones (user-driven; not engineering work):

- Real Claude Code session against the four skills to verify trigger
  phrasing fires on "wrap my CLI", "captions for this video", "audit
  my palette". Refine descriptions if under-triggers.
- 5 real users — the only signal that says whether anything else on
  this list is worth doing.

## [0.3.1] — 2026-06-20

Patch release. Documents the current status of each surface, marks
audio captions explicitly **WiP** so users don't expect a finished WER
gate, and ships one defensive fix for Ollama 0.30 MLX vision
quantizations. No behaviour change for the stable scripts.

### Added — status and roadmap

- **`README.md` → "Status" section** spells out where each of the five
  surfaces (`front-ui`, `front-cli`, `front-cli-gui`, `front-publish`,
  `front-a11y`) stands today and isolates the one WiP area (captions /
  audio). Replaces the implicit "everything is stable" reading of the
  previous README.
- **`README.md` → "Inputs → outputs" table** now flags the audio /
  video row as **WiP** and links back to "Status". Users won't be
  surprised by the missing per-language WER baselines or the
  user-supplied `vocab-biasing-clip.wav`.
- **`CHANGELOG.md` → "Roadmap"** section (below) records the four
  outstanding threads we're carrying into 0.4.0: captions baselines,
  LISEZMOI parity, full `references/` reshape, and `front-cli-gui`
  production-hardening notes.

### Changed — `front-a11y/SKILL.md`

- Captions row of the "Honest framing" table and the decision-tree
  entry both flagged *(WiP)* with a one-line pointer to
  `tests/fixtures/audio/README.md` for the current shape of the eval
  fixtures. The script itself is unchanged.

### Changed — version bumps

- All four `SKILL.md` files bumped from `0.2.0` → `0.3.1`. They were
  left at `0.2.0` through 0.3.0 by accident — this aligns the on-disk
  frontmatter with the release tag so skill consumers can tell
  versions apart.

### Fixed

- **`alt_from_ollama.py` MLX vision auto-detection** (commit
  `af010c7`). Ollama 0.30 ships MLX quantizations of Gemma vision
  models (`gemma4:e2b-mlx`) that silently discard the image input on
  some manifest variants. New `_model_has_vision(model)` queries
  `/api/show` and falls back to the non-MLX tag when the manifest
  reports no `vision` capability. Defensive: returns `True` on any
  request error so a flaky daemon doesn't silently downgrade.

## [0.3.0] — 2026-06-20

### Added — unified driver and ergonomics

- **`front-cli/` package** ships a Click-based top-level driver. A single
  `front` executable maps `front <skill> <action> [...]` onto each
  per-skill script via `subprocess`. Shell completion is documented for
  bash/zsh/fish in `front-cli/README.md`. Stdlib-only validators stay
  zero-dep when invoked directly; the driver is additive.
- **Four Ollama-backed scripts migrated from argparse to Click**:
  `alt_from_ollama.py`, `captions_from_whisper.py`, `meta_from_ollama.py`,
  `plain_language.py`. Behaviour preserved (all 323 deterministic tests
  unchanged); `--help` now formatted by Click. `install_alt_ai.py`
  gained `-h/--help` and `--model` flags.
- **Stdlib-only validators** (`lint_a11y.py`, `audit_contrast.py`,
  `simulate_cvd.py`, `site_indexes.py`, `favicons.py`, `validate.py`,
  `lint_markdown.py`, `md_to_html.py`, `install_captions.py`) gained a
  shared `_argparse.make_parser` factory that standardises `prog`,
  `formatter_class`, `epilog`, and the `-V/--version` flag — addressing
  the 13 argparse inconsistencies catalogued in `.private/click.md`.

### Added — runtime language configuration

- **`FRONT_LANG_PAIR` env var** drives the default `--lang` for the four
  Ollama-backed scripts. Precedence: explicit `--lang` flag →
  `FRONT_LANG_PAIR` first comma-split entry → existing detection
  fallback. Lets a user set their pair once (`export FRONT_LANG_PAIR="en,de"`)
  instead of repeating `--lang` on every invocation.
- **`lang_pair` frontmatter token** added to all four `SKILL.md` files
  with a "Changing the language pair" recipe section. EN/FR remains the
  example default; switching to EN/DE / EN/ES / EN/JA / … is now a
  documented per-project edit.
- **Test coverage**: `tests/test_lang.py` gained 6 new cases for
  `lang_pair_default()` (env-unset, whitespace tolerance, empty-string
  handling, precedence).

### Added — eval test suite

- **`tests/eval/`** — opt-in (`pytest -m eval`) quality bench for the
  AI-backed scripts. Four modules: `test_alt_eval.py`,
  `test_plain_language_eval.py`, `test_meta_tags_eval.py`,
  `test_captions_eval.py`. Skip cleanly when Ollama is unreachable, the
  pulled model is missing, or fixtures haven't been populated.
- **Wikipedia image fixtures** for alt-text eval. `tests/fixtures/images/
  fetch_wikipedia.py` downloads 4 hash-pinned upload.wikimedia.org
  images (informative-EN, complex-EN, functional-EN, informative-FR)
  with their human-written alt + caption as ground truth. The
  decorative case keeps a synthetic Pillow image (W3C-decorative has
  no caption to verify). DeepEval `AnswerRelevancyMetric` is the
  primary scorer; a stdlib char-trigram Jaccard fallback (≥ 0.10
  threshold) runs when DeepEval misconfigures.
- **Common Voice extractor** for captions WER bench.
  `tests/fixtures/audio/extract_cv_subset.py` (stdlib + ffmpeg) reads a
  Common Voice 26.0 tarball, stratified-samples N clips per language
  balanced on gender / age / accent (capped at 3 clips per opaque
  speaker hash), transcodes to 16 kHz mono PCM WAV, writes
  per-language `MANIFEST.json` + `STATS.json`. Idempotent via `--seed`.
  Test wires `LANGUAGES = ("en", "fr", "es")` with a parametrised
  per-language median-WER assertion (`≤ 0.10`). Adding a language is
  one line.
- `tests/test_extract_cv_subset.py` — 18 deterministic tests for the
  extractor's pure logic (filter cutoffs, stratified sampling,
  per-speaker cap, determinism with same seed, diversity stats).
- `tests/fixtures/audio/fetch.py` ships as a single-clip LibriVox /
  archive.org fallback for projects without Common Voice headroom.

### Added — release infrastructure

- **`scripts/release.sh`** — bash, no new deps. Takes a version
  argument, builds five tarballs (one per skill + a bundle), generates
  `SHA256SUMS`, and self-verifies. Prefers `shasum -a 256` (macOS) with
  `sha256sum` fallback (Linux). Prints a copy-pasteable `gh release
  create` next-steps message.
- **`.github/workflows/ci.yml`** — pytest + validator + eval-collect
  across Python 3.10 / 3.11 / 3.12 on every push and PR.
- **`.github/workflows/release.yml`** — tag-driven (`v*.*.*`) release
  via `scripts/release.sh` + `gh release create --generate-notes`.

### Added — Wikipedia / Common Voice licensing

- **`LICENSE.md` § "Bundled third-party assets"** gained a "Common
  Voice audio clips" entry documenting the CC0 dedication, voluntary
  attribution, and the platform's no-speaker-identification rule.
  Manifests record opaque CV `client_id` hashes only, never raw
  identifiers.

### Changed — honesty pass on positioning

- README + LISEZMOI gained a structured "**Who this is for**" block
  with four explicit audiences (solo devs, pentesters writing internal
  dashboards, data scientists wrapping CLIs, bilingual docs sites)
  replacing the prior "anyone building a frontend" framing.
- `LANDSCAPE.md` gained a "**Where `front` is genuinely the best
  pick**" section naming three concrete categories (CLI→GUI mock-ups
  in skill form, pre-ship a11y gates without a browser, bilingual
  docs sites with EN/FR/DE/ES/JA pairing) and a "**Where to pick
  something else**" hand-off to shadcn/ui and HTMX + classless CSS.
- `lint-a11y.md` and `contrast-audit.md` reframed: pre-commit gate
  positioning explicit, "**not a replacement for axe-core / Pa11y /
  Lighthouse**" stated up front.

### Fixed

- **`front-cli` driver was intercepting `--help` at the leaf-command
  level** instead of forwarding it to the wrapped script. Users typing
  `front a11y alt --help` saw Click's one-line stub instead of the real
  script options. Fix: `add_help_option=False` on every leaf command;
  groups keep their own help handling via `GROUP_CONTEXT_SETTINGS`.
- **`__MACOSX/` macOS-zip-artefact** added to `.gitignore`; the
  previously-tracked directory removed.
- **`tests/test_lint_markdown.py`** lost its dependence on lucky
  `sys.path` ordering after the new Click migration changed import
  order. Now uses explicit `prompts_dir=` kwarg.

### Deferred to a future release

- **Full reshaping of `references/`**. Teaching prose still mixed with
  rule-shaped content in some reference files. Future pass will split
  into `*-rules.md` + `*-guide.md` where the boundary is clear.
- **`vocab-biasing-clip.wav`** is user-supplied. The glossary contains
  project-brand terms (`pywhispercpp`, `VisionCell`, …) that no Common
  Voice contributor has uttered, so this clip stays a record-it-yourself
  asset.
- **5 real users** and a **live trigger-phrasing session against the
  updated frontmatters** are the two adoption-side milestones that
  determine whether 0.3.0 needs a fast follow-up.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-06-16

### Changed — the big restructure

- **Split the single `front/` skill into four focused skills.** The
  previous `front/SKILL.md` had a description listing twelve trigger
  phrases (build a UI, wrap this CLI, turn markdown into a site, audit,
  alt text, captions, favicons, meta, site indexes, plain language,
  contrast, CVD). Activation was sloppy and maintenance compounded.
  The new layout:
  - `front-ui/` — UI generation core (stack rules, components, design
    system, checklist, dataviz). Always install.
  - `front-cli-gui/` — CLI → GUI flagship.
  - `front-publish/` — Markdown → website + meta + favicons + site
    indexes + plain language.
  - `front-a11y/` — a11y lint + contrast audit + CVD sim + alt text +
    captions.
- **Install path changed.** Users previously copied
  `cp -r front ~/.claude/skills/front`. Now they pick the skills they
  need: `cp -r front-ui ~/.claude/skills/front-ui` plus optional
  companion folders. Existing installs should be removed first.

### Added — audience and positioning

- **Picked a real audience.** Solo developers and small teams (≤ 5)
  shipping internal tools — dev dashboards, admin panels, ML / data
  demos, CLI wrappers, research showcases. Documented "not for X" cases
  (consumer brand, marketing pages, framework-led teams, large versioned
  docs).
- **Honest CLI → GUI positioning.** Added "Why this skill, not Gradio /
  Streamlit / Tauri / Taipy" with concrete tradeoffs. The flagship
  scaffolds the GUI and ships a Python SSE proxy reference; it does not
  replace runtimes like Gradio's auto-form for ML demos.
- **Honest a11y framing.** `lint_a11y.py` is now framed as a fast
  pre-commit gate, not a replacement for axe-core / Pa11y / Lighthouse.
  `audit_contrast.py --fix` is framed as a designer hint, not a final
  decision.

### Added — typography

- **Inter is now an accepted alternate font** (Montserrat default; Inter
  for dense dev / dashboard / admin / data surfaces). Hard rule 3 in
  every SKILL.md is updated.
- **User-supplied custom typefaces are supported.** If a project ships
  a folder under `front-ui/assets/fonts/<family>/` with the TTF or
  WOFF2 files and a license file, the skill swaps `fontFamily.sans` to
  that family without touching the rest of the stack. Recipe is in
  `front-ui/references/stack-tailwind.md` → "Typography — default,
  alternate, and custom swap". The previous "two choices, no more"
  framing was too rigid for projects with brand-mismatch or
  language-coverage constraints.

### Added — i18n

- **Bilingual default is now language-pair-configurable.** The previous
  EN/FR-only baking has been dropped from SKILL.md. Projects can declare
  their pair (EN/FR, EN/DE, EN/ES, EN/JA, …) and the skill follows.
  See `front-publish/references/i18n.md` for the configuration recipe.

### Added — hygiene

- `CHANGELOG.md` (this file).
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
- `version: 0.2.0` in every SKILL.md.
- Top-level `README.md` rewritten around the four-skill structure and
  the real audience.
- `LANDSCAPE.md` preamble made honest about the comparison bias (see
  also § 1 "Quick pick" prose).

### Fixed — rule contradiction

- The previous SKILL.md hard rule 2 (Tailwind classes only) explicitly
  allowed `style="--accent: #007AFF"`, which violated rule 7 (no raw hex
  in markup). The new rule 2 forbids hex literals even inside CSS
  custom-property exceptions; semantic tokens are required.
- The previous SKILL.md sold "drops into GitHub Pages / Netlify / S3 /
  plain Nginx" without naming the Tailwind build step. New rule 3 in
  every SKILL.md is explicit about the prototype-vs-production path.

### Internal

- `meta_from_ollama.py` was importing from `alt_from_ollama.py`. With
  the split, these now live in different skills. The shared bits
  (`OLLAMA_URL`, `LANG_INSTRUCTIONS`, `detect_lang`,
  `pick_default_model`) were extracted into a small `_ollama.py` helper
  that lives in both `front-a11y/scripts/` and `front-publish/scripts/`.
- `tests/conftest.py` was updated to add all three skill `scripts/`
  directories to `sys.path`.
- `tests/test_validate.py` now invokes `front-ui/scripts/validate.py`.

### Deferred to a future release

- **Public-data tests for the AI-backed scripts.** `alt_from_ollama.py`,
  `meta_from_ollama.py`, `plain_language.py` and
  `captions_from_whisper.py` still have no test coverage. Adding
  cassette-style tests with public-domain fixtures is the next step.
- **Full reshaping of references/.** SKILL.md is now instruction-shaped
  in each skill, but the reference files still mix teaching prose with
  rule-shaped content. A future pass will move the teaching prose into
  clearly-labelled sections (or split files into `*-rules.md` and
  `*-guide.md`).
- **`LISEZMOI.md`.** The French README has not yet been brought into
  parity with the new EN README. Translation pass deferred.
- **Optional Click-based top-level driver.** See `.private/click.md`
  for the analysis. A `front-cli/` package with a unified `front` command
  is the next ergonomic improvement.

## [0.1.0] — 2025

Initial public release: single `front/` skill folder with twelve trigger
phrases, EN/FR bilingual defaults, Montserrat-only typography, ~70
reference files, 14 Python scripts.
